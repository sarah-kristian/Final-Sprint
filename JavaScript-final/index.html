      <h1>JSON, JavaScript, and MadLibs</h1>

      <br />
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project is all about using JSON data to create strings. To this
        end, I have developed madLibs-style story generator. We'll use a JSON
        file to get word lists for nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and then use
        those lists to create a story. We'll also create a class to help us
        manipulate the story.
      </p>
      <h2>Steps 1 - 4: Getting Data from JSON file</h2>
      <p>
        Here, I'm using fetch to get data from a JSON file and display it on the
        page. I'm also using a for loop to display the data in the console. To
        see this, you can open the developer tools on your browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 5: Functions for displaying JSON content</h2>
      <p>
        The JSON file contains word lists for nouns, adjectives, and verbs and
        default values for a story. We can use these to along with a class to
        play something like madLibs!
      </p>

      <p>
        To do this, we create <em>storyVersion</em> class that includes a
        function to display data from the JSON file in a template literal. We'll
        see how plays out in a moment, but first let's create two instances of
        the story: the <em>defaultVersion</em> and the <em>randomVersion</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>defaultVersion</em> takes preset default values from the JSON
        file.
      </p>

      <div class="function-container">
        <h3>defaultVersion</h3>
        <p></p>
        <div id="funct0"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <em>randomVersion</em> is created similarly, but first random items
        are selected from word lists in the JSON file to populate a instance
        with random items.
      </p>

      <div class="function-container">
        <h3>FUNCTION 1: get random item from list</h3>
        <p>
          Version 1: Returns a random item directly from an array. This is
          useful for selecting a random word from a list adjectives, for
          example.
        </p>
        <div id="funct1a"></div>
        <br />

        <p>
          Version 2: Selects a random index number based on the length of an
          array. This can be used to select the same index value for multiple
          arrays (important for us becuase different tenses of the same verb are
          in different arrays).
        </p>
        <div id="funct1b"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="function-container">
        <h3>FUNCTION 2: creates a random instance of a class</h3>
        <p>
          Returns an instance of the class <em>storyVersion</em> using randomly
          selected words from the JSON file.
        </p>
        <div id="funct2"></div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now that we have a random story, we can use the class methods to
        manipulate the story.
      </p>

      <div class="function-container">
        <h3>FUNCTION 3</h3>
        <p>
          Adds an adjective in front of each noun (noun --> adj noun). An
          example is below (just the singular versions are shown):
        </p>
        <div id="funct3"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="function-container">
        <h3>FUNCTION 4</h3>
        <p>
          Applies an instance to a template literal, giving us a retelling of
          The Three Little Pigs (note that this iteration doesn't included the
          updated nouns).
        </p>

        <div id="funct4"></div>
      </div>
      <p>You can refresh the page to get a new story each time.</p>
